# Summary
Based on the above summary, there are more male users then female users. The majority of male users use the bikes in the commuting hours. In addition, majority of the male users are subsribers. For female and short-term customers, there are no specific usage pattern for Citibike. Therefore, we should expect more male subscriber users use the bike during the commute hours.  

- I added the user type to the analysis and see what are the relation between gender and user typr. I noticed the majority of the subcribers are male. Only around quarter of subscribers are female. Therefore, the bike-sharing company could launch some promotion to attract female rider to the subscription program.

- From the anlaysis of trip duration based on user type, we can see that short-term customers have longer trip duration than subcriber as short-term customer are mainly for tourist purpose or one time use. Whereas, subsribers are for commute purpose. Therefore, in the tourist hotzones, it is expected the bike turnover would be lower, and higher turnover in bussines or office area.
